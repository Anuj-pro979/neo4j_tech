"""
Neo4j Perceptron Algorithm - A Simple AI Memory System

This is a basic implementation of a perceptron-like algorithm using Neo4j graph database.
Think of it as an AI brain that can store memories (perceptions) and find similar ones.

Author: Your Name
Date: 2025
License: MIT

How it works:
1. Store memories as nodes in a graph database
2. Connect related memories with weighted edges
3. When asked a question, find similar memories using math
4. Learn from usage by tracking which memories are accessed most

Example: If you teach it about "cats" and "dogs", and later ask about "pets",
it should be able to find the related animal memories.
